\section IOStreamOFF Object File Format (OFF)
The `OFF` file format can be used to represent collections of planar polygons with possibly shared vertices.
Although it can be as light as providing points and faces described by IDs, the format also allows
users to provide more properties such as associating normals or colors to vertices.
A precise specification of the format is available at <a href="http://www.geomview.org/docs/html/OFF.html">geomview.org</a>.

\subsection IOStreamOFFInput Reading OFF files
Objects represented in the `.OFF` format can be imported into \cgal's working environment
using the following data structures and functions.

- CGAL::Surface_mesh (\ref read_off(Surface_mesh<K>&, const std::string&)), a halfedge data structure allowing to represent polyhedral surfaces

- CGAL::Polyhedron_3 (\ref read_off( std::istream&, Polyhedron_3<PolyhedronTraits_3>&)), a halfedge data structure, which restricts the class of representable surfaces
  to orientable 2-manifolds.

- Any structure that is a model of the concept `FaceGraph` (read_off(std::istream&,FaceGraph&,NamedParameters))

- CGAL::Point_set_3 (operator>>(std::istream&,CGAL::Point_set_3<Point, Vector>&)

Polygon soups can also be imported using the function read_OFF().

As documented in the functions above, the only property that we support is the color,
and it is only supported for the CGAL::Surface_mesh.

\subsection IOStreamOFFOutput Writing OFF files
The following \cgal data structures can be exported into the `OFF` file format:

- CGAL::Surface_mesh (write_off(std::ostream&, const Surface_mesh<P>&, const NamedParameters&))
- Any structure that is a model of the concept `FaceGraph` (write_off(std::ostream&,const FaceGraph&,const NamedParameters&))
- CGAL::Point_set_3 (\ref write_off_point_set())

Polygon soups can also be exported using the function write_OFF().
Note that we only support OFF, and COFF for CGAL::Surface_mesh.


\section IOStreamOBJ Wavefront (OBJ)
The OBJ file format is a simple data-format that represents 3D geometry.
Vertices are stored in a counter-clockwise order by default, making explicit declaration of face normals unnecessary.
A precise specification of the format is available <a href="http://www.martinreddy.net/gfx/3d/OBJ.spec">here</a>.

\subsection IOStreamOBJInput Reading OBJ files
Objects represented in the `.OBJ` format can be imported into \cgal's working environment
using any structure that is a model of the concept `FaceGraph`, and the function `read_OBJ()`.

Polygon soups can also be imported using the function \ref IOstreamFunctions "read_OBJ()".

\subsection IOStreamOBJOutput Writing OBJ files
Any structure that is a model of the concept `FaceGraph` can be exported into the `OBJ` file format
using the function `write_OBJ()`.


\section IOStreamPLY Polygon File Format (PLY)
Conceived to store the data obtained during 3D scans, the `PLY` file format stores objects
as a simple list of polygons, etc.
A precise specification of those formats is available at
<a href="http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/ply/"> paulbourke.net</a>.

\subsection IOStreamPLYInput Reading PLY files
Objects represented in the `.PLY` format can be imported into \cgal's working environment
using the following data structures and functions.
- CGAL::Surface_mesh (read_ply())
- CGAL::Point_set_3 (operator>>(std::istream&,CGAL::Point_set_3<Point, Vector>&))a collection of points with dynamically associated properties

\subsection IOStreamPLYOutput Writing PLY files
The following \cgal data structures can be exported into the `PLY` file format:
- CGAL::Surface_mesh (write_ply())
- CGAL::Point_set_3 (operator<<(std::ostream&,const CGAL::Point_set_3<Point, Vector>&))


\section IOStreamSTL Standard Triangle Language (STL)
  STL is a file format native to the stereolithography CAD software created by
  3D Systems.STL files describe the surface geometry of a three-dimensional object.
  A precise specification of those formats is available at
  <a href="http://www.fabbers.com/tech/STL_Format"> fabbers.com</a>.

\subsection IOStreamSTLInput Reading STL files
Objects represented in the `.STL` format can be imported into \cgal's working environment
using any data structure that is a model of the `FaceGraph` concept, using \ref CGAL::read_STL();

In addition, if the data cannot be read in a `FaceGraph` because of bad orientation or
manifoldness, the function \link IOstreamFunctions `CGAL::read_STL(std::istream&,PointRange&,TriangleRange&,bool)` \endlink
allows to load data directly in a soup of triangles. From there, you can use \ref PMPRepairing
functions to construct a valid PolygonMesh.

\subsection IOStreamSTLOutput Writing STL files
Similarly, any data structure that is a model of the `FaceGraph` concept can be exported
as a `.STL` file using \ref CGAL::write_STL(const TriangleMesh&, std::ostream&).

Polygon soups can also be exported using the function \link IOstreamFunctions `CGAL::write_STL(const PointRange&,const TriangleRange&,std::ostream&)`. \endlink

Note that the STL file format exports triangular faces as geometric triangles and thus
lose combinatorial information.

\section IOStreamXYZ XYZ (or PWN)
The `XYZ` format is a non standard format regularly used to described point sets.
each line represent a point, and is composed of its coordinates and other properties.
We only support coordinates and normals (in that case the standard extension in CGAL
is .pwn for points with normals.)

\subsection IOStreamZYZInput Reading XYZ files
Objects represented in the `.XYZ` or `.PWN` format can be imported into \cgal's working environment
using the CGAL::Point_set_3 and the function read_xyz_point_set().

\subsection IOStreamXYZOutput Writing XYZ files
The CGAL::Point_set_3 can be exported into a `XYZ` or a `PWN` file using the function
write_xyz_point_set().

\section IOStreamVTK VTK Formats (VTU VTP)
The VTK libraries use different file formats to handle data structures, but we only support two:
- The `VTU` format can be used to store am unordered collection of 3D cells, like tetrahedra,
  but also points, triangles, lines, ... In the <a href="https://vtk.org/"> VTK Libraries</a>,
  it is the format reserved to store `Unstructured Grids`, and in \cgal,
  we use it to store triangulations(2D and 3D).

- The `VTP` format can be used to store collections of points, lines and triangles.
  In the <a href="https://vtk.org/"> VTK Libraries</a>,it is the format
  reserved to store `PolyData`., and in CGAL, we use it to store Polygon Meshes.

A precise specification of those formats is available at
<a href="https://vtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/file-formats.pdf"> vtk.org</a>.

\subsection IOStreamVTKInput Reading VTK files
Objects represented in the `VTP` format can be imported into \cgal's working environment
using the following data structures and functions.
- CGAL::Surface_mesh

using the function \ref CGAL::read_vtp(), in the condition that CGAL has been configured
with the VTK libraries.

\section IOStreamWRL
WRL is a file extension for a Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML)
file format often used by browser plug-ins to display virtual reality environments.
VRML files are known as “worlds,” which is what WRL stands for.
WRL files are plain ASCII text files.
A WRL file includes data specifying 3-D details such as vertices,
edges for a 3-D polygon, surface color, ...
A precise specification of the format is available <a href="http://gun.teipir.gr/VRML-amgem/spec/"> here</a>.
